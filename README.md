- 👋 Hi, I’m @rlkoavis1998
- 👀 I’m interested in science-fiction writing and web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who can work with me. I know HTML5 and CSS, so I can make a somewhat rough web design like mine here.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can annoy me on Twitter: @trashboypro
